What have you done for your project so far?
So far, I have created a simple usable Tetris engine, where you are able to move and rotate pieces, as well as place them on the field and clear lines. There is also a next queue where you can view the next pieces that are coming into the field. There is also indicators on how many lines have been cleared and the amount of levels (amount of pieces placed on the field), as well as some debug info (piece direction, coordinates, rotation state, etc).

What have you not done for your project yet?
I need to implement a “Hold Queue” where I can save a piece for later. Then, I need to add a way to detect the game ending, because the game doesn’t have that detection built in yet. Once that has been implemented, I can add an ending screen and a way to restart. From there, I want to make the game more difficult by adding a speed curve, a point system and other things that will make the game difficult. 

What problems, if any, have you encountered?
Learning Lua. While it’s kind of similar to python some of the syntax is much different, which i needed to learn. I thankfully got some help from some online friends of mine who were experienced with creating Tetris games. They helped me with getting through the syntax and guided me whenever I needed help, which was needed when it came to line clearing and piece detection, something I was not familiar on how to do in Lua.
