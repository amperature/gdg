**What will (likely) be the title of your project?**
Brookline: The Arcade Stacker

**In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")**
My project is creating a game of Tetris, taking inspiration from the Tetris: The Grand Master series of arcade games.

**In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?**
My game is going to be a spiritual successor to the Tetris: The Grand Master series, taking inspiration from many different other games and creating a single player experience like no other. The game will feature 2 modes: The Marathon, which is a standard game of Tetris that will last 999 levels (pieces) and will get harder and harder as the game goes on. The other mode is the Sprint mode, where you try and clear 100 pieces as fast as possible.

**If you are planning to combine LMSC-261's final project with another course's project, which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to LMSC-261, and which aspect(s) would connect to the other course?**
NONE

In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And it is not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I want to make sure that I can implement the basics mechanics of Tetris, such as piece movement, rotation, collision and the ability to clear lines.  

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I believe I can create a simple marathon mode with a timer, level counter and other necessary items required to beat the game.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The end goal is to try and create a simple but fleshed out game, with a start menu, pause options and a definite ending when you reach the required amount of pieces. 

In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
I am currently learning how to use Lua, a program which I have briefly used in the past. I have currently implemented piece movement and am now moving onto creating the different tetris pieces in the game.
